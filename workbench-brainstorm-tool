3. Workbench (keyword/concept/plot/idea/project brainstorming and thinking / organising tool)

    a. Brain dump, folder mount, file dump, email/FB/LI mount, extraction of [People, Places, Things, Concepts]  
    - summarise to keyword / 3 word title + detail
    - cluster to sentences (sequence) -> convert to bullet, or ordered list
    - cluster to paragraphs (separate lines)
    - first word (becomes bold) = cluster title and grabbable and moves the cluster
    - Must output and save to different formats:  
      
    - Could this work with Zotoro or Anki? 
    - Obsidian plugin or view or canvas
    - This could be an amazing folder / evidence / book interaction, mapping, navigation and concept manipulation tool
      
    b. Evidence Board / conspiracy map
      - Knowledge graphs (edge, node) RAG diagram
      - Anacapa charts
      - Convert to mermaid charts, or find some process diagram tools
      
    - Mindmap and brainstorm organisation tool
    - Second part needs 
      - Knowledge graph structure
      - Link lines with depth, color and direction
      - Flow for process, decision map, probability as a diagram (relationship graphs, connection circle diagram, probability charts, clustering tree, markov chain diagrams, sankey, )
      - Circle Numbers
      - Color codes (inherit from top brain dump area)
      - Toggle text detail, +links to files, @people, @peoplegroups, @locations, #concepttagging,
      - DETAIL text, images,
      - ∴ Hypothesis as a node form
      - Thesaurus generation (similar concepts, quick context add eg bulk search keywords, and come back with a context summary above detail)

      <details> 
        <summary>A knowledge graph</summary> 
      - is a structured data model representing knowledge through nodes (entities/objects) and edges (relationships/connections). 
      Nodes (e.g., people, places, concepts) are connected by directed or undirected edges that define relationships like "works at," "is part of," or "is a". 
      They often include properties, allowing for rich, semantic, and machine-understandable data.     
      - Maybe look at mindmap and flowchart tools, a competitor for Viseo and Figjam also 
      - Some other diagram tools from [WolframAlpha https://www.wolfram.com/language/11/graphs-and-networks/relationship-graphs.html]
